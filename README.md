Determines the number of moves on a chessboard that it takes a knight to move from one given spot to another

Given a chess board, your job is to write a program that takes two squares x and y as input and then
determines the number of knight moves on a shortest route from x to y .
Input Specification

consists of one line containing two squares separated by one space. A square is a string consisting of a
letter (a-h) representing the column and a digit (1-8) representing the row on the chessboard.
